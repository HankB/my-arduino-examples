# my-arduino-examples

Some simple Arduino code to demonstrate usage of micro-controllers to
my grandson.

## Motivation

Simple examples demonstrating H/W such as LEDs, speakers, pushbuttons and various sensors.

## Building

Code is presently developed using the Arduino IDE and tested on an Arduino UNO unless
stated otherwise and using the standard code -> build -> download.

## Projects

* PIR-01 Monitor a PIR (proximity) sensor and buzz a speaker and light a LED when movement is detected. Attached I/O as indicated by pin names.
* ToneRamp Drive a speaker tone from low to high frequency.


## TODO

Moar projects!
